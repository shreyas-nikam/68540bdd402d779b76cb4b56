In this lab, we explore the "AI-Q Score", a metric developed to quantify an individual's risk of job displacement due due to the increasing impact of Artificial Intelligence on the job market. This application allows you to interactively adjust various factors that contribute to this score and visualize their real-time impact.

### Core Concepts

The AI-Q Score is composed of two main components:

1.  **Idiosyncratic Risk ($$V_i(t)$$)**: This represents the individual-specific risk that can be influenced by personal actions and attributes. It is a function of:
    *   **Human Capital ($$F_{HC}$$)**: Your educational background, professional experience, role, and institution tier.
    *   **Company Risk ($$F_{CR}$$)**: The stability, financial health, and AI adoption strategy of your current employer.
    *   **Upskilling ($$F_{US}$$)**: Your efforts in acquiring new general and firm-specific skills.

    The formula for Idiosyncratic Risk is:
    $$V_i(t) = f(F_{HC}, F_{CR}, F_{US})$$

    Where:
    *   $$F_{HC} = f_{role} \cdot f_{level} \cdot f_{field} \cdot f_{school} \cdot f_{exp}$$
    *   $$F_{CR} = w_1 \cdot S_{senti} + w_2 \cdot S_{fin} + w_3 \cdot S_{growth}$$
    *   $$F_{US} = 1 - (\gamma_{gen} \cdot P_{gen}(t) + \gamma_{spec} \cdot P_{spec}(t))$$

2.  **Systematic Risk ($$H_i$$)**: This reflects the broader, macro-level risks influenced by the economic climate and the pace of AI innovation. These factors are generally beyond an individual's direct control. It is a function of:
    *   **Base Occupational Hazard ($$H_{base}(t)$$)**: The inherent risk of your occupation, potentially influenced by career transitions.
    *   **Economic Climate Modifier ($$M_{econ}$$)**: Factors like GDP growth, sector employment, and interest rates.
    *   **AI Innovation Index ($$IAI$$)**: The velocity of AI development, measured by VC funding, R&D spend, and public salience.

    The formula for Systematic Risk is:
    $$H_i = H_{base}(t) \cdot (w_{econ} \cdot M_{econ} + w_{inno} \cdot IAI)$$

    Where:
    *   $$H_{base}(k) = (1 - \frac{k}{TTV}) \cdot H_{current} + (\frac{k}{TTV}) \cdot H_{target}$$
    *   $$M_{econ} = f(GDP\ Growth, Sector\ Employment, Interest\ Rates)$$
    *   $$IAI = f(VC\ Funding, R\&D\ Spend, Public\ Salience)$$

The AI-Q Score is the combination of these two risk components, providing a holistic view of an individual's vulnerability to AI-driven job displacement.
